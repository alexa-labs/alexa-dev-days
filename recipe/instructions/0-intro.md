## What You Will Learn
Have you ever played music and needed to pause in the middle of a song? What about ordering a pizza online? If you've started an order, then leave the page, when you come back you have the option to complete your previous order. In both cases, upon our return, we have the option of continuing right where we left off, or starting over from the beginning. By persisting information in a database, we can give Alexa the capability to store a memory of a recent conversation just as a human would. Which will lead to a more natural, conversational feel to your skill from a user's perspective.

This lab will teach you how to use a database to persist information so users can pause and resume a skill, or exit then return to the same place in the conversation that they had left off.
